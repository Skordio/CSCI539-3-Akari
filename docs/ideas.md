## Recording Akari puzzles into files

- use byte encoding like previous project
- first have the dimensions of the grid recorded in bytes like the maze creator
- we can store white cells as just a 0, as they will always be white and nothing else
- black squares can be stored as sections of four bits, the first bit is a 1 and the last three bits give the value from 0 - 4
